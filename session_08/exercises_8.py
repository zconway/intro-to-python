# Session 8 Exercises


# All of these questions will use a set of pre-made files with data in. The files are in the text_files directory.
# In order to access the text files from this file, make sure you get into the text_files directory when using read/write.
# Ex: f = open("text_files/austen.txt", "r") OR f = open("text_files/register.txt", "w")


## Section A
# 1. Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen.
f1 = open("text_files/jabberwocky.txt", "r")
# print(f1.read())

# 2. Read the file 'austen.txt' and print the amount of lines in the file.
f2 = open("text_files/austen.txt", "r")
count = 0
for x in f2:
  count += 1

# print(count)
# print(f2.read())


# 3. Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file.
total = 0
for x in open("text_files/numbers.txt"):
    total += int(x)

# print(total)

# <---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Section B
# 1. Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called 'register.txt'.
# newFile = open("text_files/register.txt", "x")
# newFile.write(input("What is your name? "))

# 2. Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'.
# newFile2 = open("text_files/even.txt", "x")
# for x in open("text_files/numbers.txt"):
#     if int(x) % 2 == 0:
#       newFile2.write(x)

# 3. 'secret.txt' contains a secret message. Each number represents the letter of the alphabet where 1 = A, 2 = B ... Z = 26. 
#    Work out what the secret message says.
alphabet = {
    0: "!",
    1: "A",
    2: "B",
    3: "C",
    4: "D",
    5: "E",
    6: "F",
    7: "G",
    8: "H",
    9: "I",
    10: "J",
    11: "K",
    12: "L",
    13: "M",
    14: "N",
    15: "O",
    16: "P",
    17: "Q",
    18: "R",
    19: "S",
    20: "T",
    21: "U",
    22: "V",
    23: "W",
    24: "X",
    25: "Y",
    26: "Z"
}

word = ""
for x in open("text_files/secret.txt", "r"):
    x = int(x)
    word = word + alphabet[x]
print(word)

# 4. Benfordâ€™s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. 
#   For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). 
#   Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. 
#   Work out which of the files contains fake data.
file5 = open("text_files/even.txt", "w")
